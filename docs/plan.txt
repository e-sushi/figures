@TODOs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] console mode
    [x] input loop ()
    [x] pass input to parser
    [x] show output of parser
    [ ] built-in history
    [ ] autocomplete
        this can probably go through the same autocomplete system the visual mode will have, so design it with that in mind

[ ] variables // sushi
    [ ] internal representation 
        this should include a full name and short description, possibly with links to references about it
        optionally, variables store a value
    [ ] integrate into solver
        [ ] numerical solving around a variable
        [ ] solving for a variable

[ ] constants
    [ ] internal representation
    [ ] file
        [ ] determine a format
        [ ] loading from a file
            [ ] filtering 
        [ ] making and saving a new constant to the file in the app

[ ] solving
    [ ] implicit multiplication
        a space between tokens implies multiplication in most cases
    [x] numerical operations
        [x] addition/subtraction (03/11/22, delle)
        [x] multiplication/division (03/12/22, delle)
        [x] parenthesis (04/05/22, delle)
        [x] exponentials (04/05/22, delle)
        [x] modulo (04/05/22, delle)
        [ ] bit OR/AND/XOR/shift
        [ ] logical OR/AND
    [x] literals (03/11/22, delle)
    [x] equals (03/14/22, delle)
    [ ] variables
        [ ] numerical solving around a variable (eg. literal simplification)
        [ ] solving for a variable
    [ ] complex math
        [ ] implicit multiplication between variables (and constants)
        [ ] variable super/subscript
        [ ] inequalities
        [ ] integrals/derivatives
        [ ] limits
        [ ] function notation
        [ ] sum
        [ ] patterns (python colon, c for, ellipses)
        [ ] vectors/matrices
        [ ] Â± (plus or minus)
    [ ] functions 
        [x] builtin system (04/06/22, delle)
            a system for defining builtin numerical functions
        [ ] user-defined
    [ ] hotstrings (turn into symbols or place slots in non-linear ways)

Everything in this file is a feature, no bugs.
Plans are tasks a contributor plans to do in chronological order.

Top-level TODO names should be short
Sub-level TODOs must be dated when completed and the name of who completed it should be added.
Top-level TODOs are not moved to @complete until all sub-TODOs are finished, when it is moved you must date the top-level TODO with its finished date. 

Formatting:
[ ] - A TODO that has not been started yet
[x] - A TODO that has been finished
